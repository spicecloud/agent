# Federated Learning

Averaging model parameters in PyTorch involves iterating over the parameters of each model and taking their average. Here is a simple example of how you might do this for two models:

```python
def average_models(model1, model2):
    model_avg = copy.deepcopy(model1)
    for param1, param2 in zip(model_avg.parameters(), model2.parameters()):
        param1.data.copy_((param1.data + param2.data) / 2)
    return model_avg
```

This function creates a new model (model_avg) that is a copy of model1, then iterates over the parameters of model1 and model2, averages them, and stores the result in model_avg.

If you have more than two models, you can extend this approach like this:

```python
def average_models(models):
    model_avg = copy.deepcopy(models[0])
    for param_avg in model_avg.parameters():
        param_avg.data.zero_()

    for model in models:
        for param_avg, param in zip(model_avg.parameters(), model.parameters()):
            param_avg.data.add_(param.data)

    for param_avg in model_avg.parameters():
        param_avg.data.div_(len(models))

    return model_avg

```

In this function, models is a list of models to be averaged. The function first initializes model_avg to be a copy of the first model, then zeros out its parameters. It then adds the parameters of each model to model_avg, and finally divides by the number of models to take the average.

Note: Be careful with this approach if your models are very large or if you have a lot of models, as it requires storing all the models in memory at once. If this is an issue, you may need to use a more memory-efficient approach.

# Patience

patience is the number of epochs to wait to see if the validation loss will decrease
before stopping the training. The training will stop if the validation loss hasn't
decreased in patience number of epochs.

```python
num_epochs = 100
patience = 10
best_loss = float('inf')
epochs_no_improve = 0

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Training process...

    # Validation process...
    validation_loss = # Compute validation loss here...

    if validation_loss < best_loss:
        best_loss = validation_loss
        epochs_no_improve = 0
    else:
        epochs_no_improve += 1
        if epochs_no_improve == patience:
            print('Early stopping!')
            break
```
